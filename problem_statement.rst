Please write a **simple web crawler** in a language of your choice.

The crawler should be limited to one domain. Given a starting URL – say
http://wiprodigital.com - it should visit all pages within the domain, but
not follow the links to external sites such as Google or Twitter.

The output should be a simple structured site map (this does not need to be a
traditional XML sitemap - just some sort of output to reflect what your crawler
has discovered), showing links to other pages under the same domain, links to
external URLs and links to static content such as images for each respective
page.

Please provide a README.md file that explains how to run / build your solution.
Also, detail anything further that you would like to achieve with more time.
